Revision history for Search::Elasticsearch::Async

1.15    2014-11-05
        Enhancements:
         *  All async backends now default to not verifying
            SSL identities, but accept ssl_options to allow
            backend-specific configuration
         *  Improved Mojo exceptions

1.13    2014-06-13
        Breaking change:
            The Async::Scroll helper used to pass the scroll ID to
            scroll() and clear_scroll() in the query string by default,
            with the scroll_in_body parameter to change the behaviour.
            This was causing frequent errors with long scroll IDs, so
            the new default behaviour is to pass the scroll ID in the
            body, with the scroll_in_qs parameter to change that
            behaviour.
        All Search::Elasticsearch::Async HTTP backends are now fork safe.
